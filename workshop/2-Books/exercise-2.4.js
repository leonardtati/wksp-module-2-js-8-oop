// Exercise 2.4
// We need methods in our BookList start reading and finish reading books
//      - startReading accepts a title parameter. (The book should already be in your books array.
//          - set currentlyReading
//          - set the startReadDate in the book object to new Date(Date now());
//      - finishREading accepts a title parameter.
//          - set lastRead to title
//          - update the book's object accordingly.
//          - update the read and unread count accordingly.

// console.log(homeLibrary) when you're done adding, starting and finishing books.
// Make sure that your changes are reflected in the homeLibrary.
// From 2.1. and 2.2
